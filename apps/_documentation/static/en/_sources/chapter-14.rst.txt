=======
py4web comes with a Grid object providing grid and CRUD (create, update and delete) capabilities.
This allows you to quickly and safely provide an interface to your data. Since it's also
highly customizable, it's the corner stone of most py4web's applications.
>>>>>>> upstream/master

Key Features
------------

-  Full CRUD with Delete Confirmation
-  Click column heads for sorting - click again for DESC
-  Pagination control
-  Built in Search (can use search_queries OR search_form)
-  Action Buttons - with or without text
-  Pre and Post Action (add your own buttons to each row)
-  Grid dates in local format
-  Default formatting by type plus user overrides

Basic Example
-------------

In this simple example we will make a grid over the superhero table.

Create a new minimal app called ``grid``. Change it with the following content.

.. code:: python

   # in grid/__init__.py
   import os
   from py4web import action, Field, DAL
   from py4web.utils.grid import Grid, GridClassStyleBulma
   from py4web.utils.form import Form, FormStyleBulma
   from yatl.helpers import A


   # database definition
   DB_FOLDER = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), 'databases')
   if not os.path.isdir(DB_FOLDER):
      os.mkdir(DB_FOLDER)
   db = DAL('sqlite://storage.sqlite', folder=DB_FOLDER)
   db.define_table(
      'person',
      Field('name'),
      Field('job'))

   # add example entries in db
   if not db(db.person).count():
      db.person.insert(name='Clark Kent', job='Journalist')
      db.person.insert(name='Peter Park', job='Photographer')
      db.person.insert(name='Bruce Wayne', job='CEO')
      db.commit()

   @action('index', method=['POST', 'GET'])
   @action('index/<path:path>', method=['POST', 'GET'])
   @action.uses(db, 'grid.html')
   def index(path=None):
         grid = Grid(path,
                  formstyle=FormStyleDefault, # FormStyleDefault or FormStyleBulma
                  grid_class_style=GridClassStyle, # GridClassStyle or GridClassStyleBulma      
                  query=(db.person.id > 0),
                  orderby=[db.person.name],
                  search_queries=[['Search by Name', lambda val: db.person.name.contains(val)]])

      return dict(grid=grid)

Add a new file templates/grid.html with this basic content:

::

   [[=grid.render()]]

Then restart py4web. If you browse to http://127.0.0.1:8000/grid/index you'll get this
result:

.. image:: images/grid.png

<<<<<<< HEAD
   @action('companies', method=['POST', 'GET'])
   @action('companies/<path:path>', method=['POST', 'GET'])
   @action.uses(session, db, auth, 'grid.html')
   def companies(path=None):
       grid = Grid(path,
                   query=(db.company.id > 0),
                   orderby=[db.company.name],
                   search_queries=[['Search by Name', lambda val: db.company.name.contains(val)]])

Its layout is quite minimal, but it's perfectly usable.

The main problem is that by default the **no.css** stylesheet is used, see
`here <https://github.com/mdipierro/no.css/>`__. But we've not loaded it!
Change the file templates/grid.html with this content:

::

   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html>
      <head>
         <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/5.14.0/css/all.min.css"  />
      </head>
      <body>
         [[=grid.render()]]
      <body>
   </html>



Then refresh the page.


.. image:: images/grid_nocss.png


This is better now, with proper icons for Details, Edit and Delete actions.

We can also think about using the **bulma.css**, 
see `here <https://bulma.io/>`__. In this case you need to change
the grid object on __init__.py to:

.. code:: python


   formstyle=FormStyleBulma, # FormStyleDefault or FormStyleBulma
   grid_class_style=GridClassStyleBulma, #GridClassStyle or GridClassStyleBulma

Notice that in this case you need to import the corresponding python modules in advance
(we've already done it on line 4 and 5 above). Instead if you use the default no.css style
you don't need to manually import its style modules (and you even don't need the formstyle
and grid_class_style parameters).

You also need to change the file templates/grid.html with this content:

::

   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html>
      <head>
         <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/bulma/0.9.3/css/bulma.min.css">
      </head>
      <body>
            [[=grid.render()]]
      <body>
   </html>

Then refresh the page.

.. image:: images/grid_bulmacss.png


This is much better, isn't it?


.. Note::
   These are just minimal examples for showing how ``grid`` works internally.
   Normally you should start from a copy of the standard ``_scaffold`` app, with all
   the Session and Authentication stuff already defined. Also, you should
   follow the standard rules for code, like placing the db definition inside
   models.py and so on.
   Using standards will make your code simpler, safer and more maintainable.

In the  in the  :ref:`Advanced topics and examples` chapter you can find
more examples, including a master/detail grid example written with **htmx**.

Searching and Filtering
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are two ways to build a search form:

-  Provide a search_queries list
-  Build your own custom search form

If you provide a search_queries list to grid, it will:

-  build a search form. If more than one search query in the list, it
   will also generate a dropdown to select which search field to search
   against
-  gather filter values and filter the grid

However, if this doesnâ€™t give you enough flexibility you can provide
your own search form and handle all the filtering (building the queries)
by yourself.

CRUD settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The grid provides CRUD (create, read, update and delete) capabilities
utilizing py4web Form.
You can turn off CRUD features by setting
create/details/editable/deletable during grid instantiation.

Additionally, you can provide a separate URL to the
create/details/editable/deletable parameters to bypass the
auto-generated CRUD pages and handle the detail pages yourself.

Custom Columns
--------------

If the grid does not involve a join but displays results from a single table
<<<<<<< HEAD
you can specify a list of columns and columns are highly customizable.

you can specify a list of columns. Columns are highly customizable.
>>>>>>> upstream/master

.. code:: python

   from py4web.utils.grid import Column
   from yatl helpers import A

   columns = [
      db.company.id,
      db.company.name,
      Column("Web Site", lambda row: f"https://{row.name}.com"),
      Column("Go To", lambda row: A("link", _href=f"https://{row.name}.com"))
   ]

   grid = Grid(... columns=columns ...) 

Notice in this example the first two columns are regular fields,
The third column has a header "Web Site" and consists of URL strings generated from the rows.
The fourth column has a header "Go To" and generates actual clickable links using the ``A`` helper.


Using templates
---------------

Use the following to render your grid or CRUD forms in your templates.

Display the grid or a CRUD Form

::

   [[=grid.render()]]

To allow for customizing CRUD form layout (like with web2py) you can use
the following

::

   [[form = grid.render() ]]
   [[form.custom["begin"] ]]
   ...
   [[form.custom["submit"]
   [[form.custom["end"]

When handling custom form layouts you need to know if you are displaying
the grid or a form. Use the following to decide

::

   [[if request.query.get('action') in ('details', 'edit'):]]
       #  Display the custom form
       [[form = grid.render() ]]
       [[form.custom["begin"] ]]
       ...
       [[form.custom["submit"]
       [[form.custom["end"]
   [[else:]]
       [[grid.render() ]]
   [[pass]]

Customizing Style
-----------------

You can provide your own formstyle or grid classes and style to grid.

-  formstyle is the same as a Form formstyle, used to style the CRUD
   forms.
-  grid_class_style is a class that provides the classes and/or styles
   used for certain portions of the grid.

The default GridClassStyle - based on no.css, primarily uses styles to
modify the layout of the grid. We've already seen that it's possible
to use other class_style, in particular GridClassStyleBulma.

You can even build your own class_style to be used with the css framework of
your choice.

Custom Action Buttons
---------------------

As with web2py, you can add additional buttons to each row in your grid.
You do this by providing pre_action_buttons or post_action_buttons to
the Grid **init** method.

-  pre_action_buttons - list of action_button instances to include
   before the standard action buttons
-  post_action_buttons - list of action_button instances to include
   after the standard action buttons

You can build your own Action Button class to pass to pre/post action
buttons based on the template below (this is not provided with py4web)

Sample Action Button Class
--------------------------

.. code:: python

   def __init__(self,
                url,
                text,
                icon="fa-calendar",
                additional_classes=None,
                message=None,
                append_id=False):

-  url: the page to navigate to when the button is clicked
-  text: text to display on the button
-  icon: the font-awesome icon to display before the text
-  additional_classes: a space-separated list of classes to include on
   the button element
-  message: confirmation message to display if â€˜confirmationâ€™ class is
   added to additional classes
-  append_id: if True, add id_field_name=id_value to the url querystring
   for the button

Reference Fields
----------------

When displaying fields in a PyDAL table, you sometimes want to display a
more descriptive field than a foreign key value. There are a couple of
ways to handle that with the py4web grid.

``filter_out`` on PyDAL field definition - here is an example of a foreign
key field

.. code:: python

   Field('company', 'reference company',
         requires=IS_NULL_OR(IS_IN_DB(db, 'company.id',
                                      '%(name)s',
                                      zero='..')),
         filter_out=lambda x: x.name if x else ''),

This will display the company name in the grid instead of the company ID

The downfall of using this method is that sorting and filtering are
based on the company field in the employee table and not the name of the
company

``left join`` and specify fields from joined table - specified on the left
parameter of Grid instantiation

.. code:: python

   db.company.on(db.employee.company == db.company.id)

You can specify a standard PyDAL left join, including a list of joins to
consider.
Now the company name field can be included in your fields list can be
clicked on and sorted.

Also you can specify a query such as:

.. code:: python

   queries.append((db.employee.last_name.contains(search_text)) | (db.employee.first_name.contains(search_text)) | db.company.name.contains(search_text)))

This method allows you to sort and filter, but doesnâ€™t allow you to
combine fields to be displayed together as the filter_out method would

You need to determine which method is best for your use case
understanding the different grids in the same application may need to
behave differently.
